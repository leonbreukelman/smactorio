### Current State

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Describe the existing infrastructure situation or lack thereof.
-->

[Description of current infrastructure state, e.g., "Applications currently run on aging on-premises servers with frequent outages, no disaster recovery, and manual scaling requiring 2-3 hours response time."]

### Desired State

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Describe the target infrastructure capabilities and characteristics.
-->

[Description of target infrastructure state, e.g., "Cloud-native infrastructure with auto-scaling, multi-region failover, and zero-downtime deployments managed through Infrastructure as Code."]
