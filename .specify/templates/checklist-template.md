# [CHECKLIST TYPE] Checklist: [INFRASTRUCTURE NAME]

**Purpose**: [Brief description of what this checklist covers]
**Created**: [DATE]
**Infrastructure**: [Link to spec.md or relevant documentation]

**IMPORTANT**: This checklist validates REQUIREMENTS QUALITY, not implementation.

Think of it as **"unit tests for English"** - we're testing whether requirements are:
- **Complete**: All necessary requirements present?
- **Clear**: Requirements specific and unambiguous?
- **Consistent**: Requirements align without conflicts?
- **Measurable**: Can requirements be objectively verified?
- **Covered**: All scenarios/edge cases addressed?

**NOT for testing implementation** - We're NOT checking if code works, but if requirements are well-written.

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/iac.checklist` command based on infrastructure context and requirements.
