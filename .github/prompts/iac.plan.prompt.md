$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for INFRA_SPEC, ARCH_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read INFRA_SPEC and `./specify.specify/memory/principles.md`. Load ARCH_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in ARCH_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (cloud provider, IaC tool, versions - mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Principles Check section from principles (technology stack validation)
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve cloud/tool selection, best practices)
   - Phase 1: Design Infrastructure Architecture (compute, storage, networking, security, state management)
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Principles Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 1 planning. Report branch, ARCH_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Technology Selection & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - Cloud provider selection (if not specified in principles)
   - IaC tool and version (if not specified in principles)
   - State management strategy
   - Multi-environment approach
   - Infrastructure patterns and best practices

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {infrastructure context}"
   For IaC tool (if not specified):
     Task: "Best practices for {Terraform/Pulumi/CloudFormation} for {use case} on {cloud provider}"
   For well-architected framework (MANDATORY REFERENCE):
     Task: "Study {cloud provider} Well-Architected Framework / Best practices and document applicable pillars/principles:
       - AWS: 6 pillars (Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, Sustainability)
       - Azure: 5 pillars (Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, Reliability, Security)
       - GCP: 5 principles (Operational Excellence, Security Privacy & Compliance, Reliability, Cost Optimization, Performance & Scalability)
       - IBM Cloud: Use the Framework for Financial Services and IBM Cloud best practices
     Map framework recommendations to infrastructure requirements.
     Identify which pillar applies to each component and document specific best practices to follow."
   For curated modules (PREFERRED APPROACH):
     Task: "Identify and recommend curated modules as the PRIMARY implementation approach:
       - AWS: terraform-aws-modules (Terraform Registry verified)
       - Azure: Azure Verified Modules (Microsoft official)
       - IBM Cloud: terraform-ibm-modules (IBM official)
       - GCP: terraform-google-modules (Google Cloud official)
       - Pulumi: Official Pulumi packages for each cloud provider
     Document specific modules for each infrastructure component (VPC, compute, database, etc.).
     For production stability: Recommend exact version pinning (= X.Y.Z) for modules since they are NOT captured in .terraform.lock.hcl.
     For development: ~> X.Y allows flexibility for testing minor updates.
     Only recommend direct provider resources when: custom requirements not supported by modules, very simple single resources, or modules add unnecessary complexity.
     Provide rationale for any direct resource usage."
   For patterns:
     Task: "Research {multi-region/DR/state-management/scaling} patterns on {cloud provider}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen - cloud provider, IaC tool, versions]
   - Rationale: [why chosen - cost, features, team expertise, ecosystem]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated and why rejected]
   - Well-Architected Framework (MANDATORY): [applicable pillars/principles mapped to infrastructure components with specific best practices]
   - Curated Modules (PRIMARY APPROACH): [specific modules/packages identified for each component with versions, rationale for any direct resource usage]
   - Best practices: [key patterns to follow]
   - References: [documentation links, examples, module registries]

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved. This single file consolidates ALL research findings - do not create separate files for module research, provider analysis, or other research topics.

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Architecture Design

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete with all technology decisions made

1. **Design infrastructure architecture** → `architecture.md`:
   - Compute Resources: instances, containers, serverless, auto-scaling
   - Data Storage: databases, object storage, caching, backups
   - Networking: VPC/VNet, subnets, routing, DNS, load balancing
   - Security: IAM/RBAC, security groups, encryption, secrets
   - Environment Configuration: dev/staging/prod differences
   - State Management: backend, locking, backup strategy

2. **Define module specifications** (if using modules) → `modules.md`:
   - Module name and purpose
   - Input variables with validation
   - Output values
   - Dependencies between modules
   - Testing strategy

3. **Create provisioning guide** → `quickstart.md`:
   - Prerequisites (tools, accounts, credentials)
   - State backend setup if any (no state backend setup if using local, or managed iac service such as HashiCorp terraform or IBM Cloud Schematics)
   - Provisioning commands (init, plan, apply)
   - Manual validation steps
   - Rollback procedures
   **IMPORTANT**: ❌ Do NOT include IaC code, e.g: terraform code in this file. The IaC code will be generated in next phase by /iac.implement command.

4. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add cloud provider and IaC tool to technology stack
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: `architecture.md`, `modules.md`, `quickstart.md`, agent-specific file updated. Generate only these specified files - all prior research remains consolidated in research.md.

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications
